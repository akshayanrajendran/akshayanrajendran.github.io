👨‍💻 I'm a Computer Engineering Freshman at Toronto Metropolitan University, Canada

🚀 I love aerospace, aviation, and computer technology and aspire to do research in these sectors in the future.

🎵 I am also a Indian classical carnatic percussionist and a national level quizzer.

⚙️ As a creative and determined individual, I like to explore and learn more in the domain of science and technology.
