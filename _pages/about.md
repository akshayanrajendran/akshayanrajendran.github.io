👨‍💻 I am a Computer Engineering freshman at Toronto Metropolitan University in Canada


🚀 I have a keen interest in CS, AI, and Aerospace, aspiring to do research in these sectors in the future.

🎵 I am also an classical carnatic percussionist (indian music) and a national level quizzer.

⚙️ As a creative and determined individual, I am committed to explore and learn more in the domain of science and technology.



























## Some Photos :D (attempt to document stuff)
